# Gym App Generator

The Gym Workout Generator is a user-friendly application designed to help fitness enthusiasts and anime fans to plan effective and personalized workout routines. Whether you're a beginner looking to establish a fitness routine or a seasoned gym-goer seeking fresh workout ideas, this application has you covered. The reason why I chose to do a anime themed gym app instead of normal gym application is because lots of anime fans go to the gym.
